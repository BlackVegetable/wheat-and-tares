.SH NAME
wheat-and-tares \- client for sending secure messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
wheat-and-tares [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
wheat-and-tares is a client for sending secure messages without the use of encryption to hide any information. Rather the encryption is only used to authenticate. Complimentary message bits (tares) are sent at the same time as the actual message bits but are authenticated randomly. This leaves only the recipient sharing the authentication key with the capability to read the intended message.
